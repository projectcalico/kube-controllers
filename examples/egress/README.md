This examples show how to create Egress Rules:

1) Create a third party resource called egresspolicy, with the following command:

``kubectl create -f egress-resouce-yaml``

2) Create some Egress Policy (like the Network Policy), as the following example file:

``kubectl create -f egress-policy.yaml``
